CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
- Write from the perspective of the person in the image (use "I", "me", "my")
- Sound authentic, personal, and human - like a real person sharing their moment
- Express genuine emotions, thoughts, or personality
- Avoid generic, detached descriptions about the image
- Make it feel like a real social media post someone would proudly share

      systemInstruction += `LENGTH: Detailed (25-40 words) - deeper personal reflection or storytelling\n`;
      break;
    default:
      systemInstruction += `LENGTH: Medium (15-25 words) - natural personal expression\n`;

  // Handle hashtags in a personal way

    systemInstruction += `HASHTAGS: Include 2-4 relevant hashtags that feel organic to the post\n`;
  } else {
    systemInstruction += `HASHTAGS: No hashtags\n`;

  // Handle extra instructions while maintaining first-person perspective
  if (extraInstructions && extraInstructions.trim() !== '') {
    systemInstruction += `SPECIAL REQUEST: ${extraInstructions.trim()} (while keeping it first-person and authentic)\n`;

  // Add core first-person writing principles

WRITING STYLE:
- Use contractions (I'm, don't, can't) for natural speech
- Express personal feelings, thoughts, or reactions
- Share what this moment means to YOU in the photo
- Sound like a real person, not a corporate brand
- Be relatable and human - imperfections make it authentic
- Show personality through word choice and tone

EXAMPLES OF GOOD FIRST-PERSON CAPTIONS:
- "Living for these golden hour vibes ðŸŒ… This is my happy place."
- "Sometimes you just have to create the moments you're waiting for âœ¨"
- "Me: trying to look casual while a butterfly lands on my hand ðŸ¦‹ My heart: literally melting"
- "This view hit different today. Grateful for moments that remind me what matters ðŸ’«"

AVOID:
- Third-person descriptions ("This photo shows...")
- Generic statements ("Beautiful view")
- Impersonal observations ("The person in this image...")
- Overly polished or corporate language`;
